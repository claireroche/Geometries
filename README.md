Collection of geometries 2D and 3D, mostly for Computational Fluid Dynamics.

# Formats
* .hdf: This is the studies format of the CAO Software Shaper, from the [Salome](https://docs.salome-platform.org/latest/main/index.html) platform.
* .brep: This is a representation of a solid by its surfaces. This is readable by [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/).
* .geo: This is a CAO format. This format is readable by [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/).

# Geometries 2D

### C?_2D
These are elementary test geometries.


# Geometries 3D

### C?_3D
These are elementary test geometries.

**Observation:** C1_3D for exemple is not a 3D extension of C1_2D.
